    <h2>Lesson 1: Understanding How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>This lesson introduced you to the concept of using HTML to mark up text files to produce web content. You learned that HTML generates the structure, while CSS creates the look, and JavaScript controls the behavior of the pages. You also learned that there is more to web content than just the “page”; web content also includes image, audio, and video files. All this content lives on a web server—a remote machine often far from your own computer. On your computer or other device, you use a web browser to request, retrieve, and eventually display web content onscreen.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A very brief history of the World Wide Web</li>
        <li>What is meant by the term web page and why this term doesn’t always reflect all the content involved</li>
        <li>How content gets from your personal computer to someone else’s web browser</li>
        <li>How to select a web hosting provider</li>
        <li>How different web browsers and device types can affect your content</li>
        <li>How to transfer files to your web server by using FTP</li>
        <li>Where files should be placed on a web server</li>
        <li>How to distribute web content without a web server</li>
        <li>How to use other publishing methods, such as blogs</li>
        <li>Tips for testing the appearance and functionality of web content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 2: Structuring an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>This lesson introduced the basics of what web pages are and how they work. You learned that coded HTML commands are included in a text file, and you saw that typing HTML text yourself is better than using a graphical editor that creates HTML commands for you—especially when you’re learning HTML.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>How to create a simple web page in HTML</li>
            <li>How to include all the HTML tags that every web page must have</li>
            <li>How to organize a page with paragraphs and line breaks</li>
            <li>How to organize your content with headings</li>
            <li>How to use the semantic elements of HTML5</li>
            <li>How to use semantic tags to indicate header and footer content</li>
            <li>How to use semantic tags to indicate navigational and secondary content</li>
            <li>How to use semantic tags to better structure body content</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="lesson3"></div>
    <h2>Lesson 3: Understanding Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, you learned that a style sheet can control the appearance of many HTML pages at once. It can also give you extremely precise control over the typography, spacing, and positioning of HTML elements. You also learned that, by adding a style attribute to almost any HTML tag, you can control the style of any part of an HTML page without referring to a separate style sheet document.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How to create a basic style sheet</li>
            <li>How to use style classes</li>
            <li>How to use style IDs</li>
            <li>How to construct internal style sheets and inline styles</li>
        </ul>
    
    <div id="lesson4"></div>
    <h2>Lesson 4: Understanding JavaScript</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you’ve learned what web scripting is and what JavaScript is. You’ve also learned how to insert a script into an HTML document or refer to an external JavaScript file, what sorts of things JavaScript can do, and how JavaScript differs from other web languages. You also wrote a simple JavaScript program and tested it using a web browser. You also learned how to modify and test scripts, and you saw what happens when a JavaScript program runs into an error.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What web scripting is and what it’s good for</li>
            <li>How scripting and programming are different (and similar)</li>
            <li>What JavaScript is and where it came from</li>
            <li>How to include JavaScript commands in a web page</li>
            <li>What JavaScript can do for your web pages</li>
            <li>Beginning and ending scripts</li>
            <li>Formatting JavaScript statements</li>
            <li>How a script can display a result</li>
            <li>Including a script within a web document</li>
            <li>Testing a script in a browser</li>
            <li>Modifying a script</li>
            <li>Dealing with errors in scripts</li>
            <li>Moving scripts into separate files</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 5: Validating and Debugging Your Code</h2>
    <p>In this lesson you learned various ways to validate and debug issues in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You learned how to use the inspector within Developer Tools in your browser to see the HTML elements and CSS styles and properties that the browser has rendered while loading a web page. In addition, you learned the basics of reviewing JavaScript syntax errors in the Console and setting breakpoints and systematically stepping through the code to debug more complex problems.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How to validate your HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>How to use Developer Tools to debug HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>How to use the JavaScript Console to debug JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
